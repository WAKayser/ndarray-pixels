# ndarray-pixels

Convert ndarray â†” image data, for Web and Node.js.

Closely based on [get-pixels](https://www.npmjs.com/package/get-pixels) and [save-pixels](https://www.npmjs.com/package/save-pixels), with added support for use on the web without depending on polyfills for Node.js builtins. In Node.js, the `save-pixels` and `get-pixels` packages are used directly.
